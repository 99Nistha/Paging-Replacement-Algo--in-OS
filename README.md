# Paging-Replacement-Algo--in-OS

ABSTRACT
Page Replacement Algorithm
In an operating system that uses paging for memory management, a page replacement algorithm is needed to decide which page needs to be replaced when new page comes in.
Page Fault: When we want to load the page on the memory, and the page is not stored in memory, then it is called page fault.
Page Hit: When we want to load the page on the memory, and the page is already available in memory, then it is called page hit.
Memory management unit: The run time mapping between Virtual address and Physical Address is done by hardware device known as MMU.
Page Replacement Algorithms :
    • First In First Out (FIFO) –
    • Optimal Page replacement
    • Least Recently Used
